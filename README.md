# BrainTease-A-trivia-game
Simple multiple-choice quiz on gen-z /millennial based pop culture knowledge. Made in IntelliJ IDE, using JavaFX and Scenebuilder.

IMPORTANT!!!
-Make sure JDK is properly configured. Version 17 and above recommended

-The main driver of the program is a class containing the word "BrainTease". You can run the program from this file

-Upon running the program, the GUI should pop up with a _dazzling_ home screen. If not, try this...

  -Go to the "braintease_final" folder and unravel the directories (target > classes > com > example > braintease_final). If there isn't a "style.css" in there with the rest of the files, you are going to want to copy the style.css file in "src > main > java > com.example.braintease_final" folder, and paste it into "braintease_final" folder, i.e. the folder you unraveled from before. This should show a background as well as change elements of the GUI
  
-Should the program not run, giving an error like "Error: Could not find or load main class com.example.braintease_final.BrainTeaseTriviaGame
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.braintease_final.BrainTeaseTriviaGame". You are going to want to make sure path of the class Driver matches that of the package.
